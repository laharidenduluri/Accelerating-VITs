Pruning the Vit's to achieve better performance

The swin model architecture which is generally used in the computer vision tasks ,we use it in the image classification task has higher computational complexity because of its architectural requirements. So we implement the process of pruning which can enable the model to perform better. The pruning methodology mainly involves to first prune the heads , that is done on the multi head attention layers and then the SVD combined with the IHT helps to prune the linear layers of the swin model. We extract the weights from the pretrained Swin model and perform the pruning.We train the model initailly with the datatsets ( 1. cifar10 and 2. Caltech-101) , get the weights, prune the model and then finetune the model by trainiing it again. At last wet test the model and measure its accuracy with the test dataset before and after pruning. The main metrics for the measure of our pruning technique is the flop reeduction, total number of non zero parameters and the model size.
